# Cool-Employee-Tracker

## Description

The Cool-Employee-Tracker is a command-line application designed to manage a company's employee database, using Node.js, Inquirer, and MySQL. The motivation behind this project was to create an efficient, easy-to-use interface for managing employee information, including departments, roles, and employee details. This project addresses the need for a streamlined process to view, add, update, and delete employee data in a quick and organized manner. While building this application, I learned to effectively interact with a MySQL database through Node.js, manage asynchronous operations, and develop a deeper understanding of relational database concepts.
